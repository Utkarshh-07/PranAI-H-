# 🌊 PranAI - AI Mental Wellness for Indian Students

**PranAI means → "Intelligence that nurtures your life energy"**

## 📌 Important Note for Judges

Everything marked "✅ Demo Ready" above is genuinely built and working — the 
UI, the navigation flows, the gamification system, the parent dashboard, 
the 4-level safety protocol logic — all of it runs live in this build.

Two things are intentionally simplified for this submission, and I want 
to be upfront about exactly what and why:

**AI responses are currently rule-based, not live LLM-generated.** The 
architecture is built to plug in GPT-5.4 Mini directly — the integration 
point exists in the codebase — but for this hackathon I used keyword-based 
emotional detection instead of a live API call, to keep the demo fast and 
reliable for judging without API latency or cost during evaluation.

**Push notifications are simulated via local notifications, not FCM.** 
The real-time alert *logic* — what triggers an alert, what a parent sees 
versus what stays private — is fully implemented and demonstrated. The 
delivery mechanism (actual cross-device push via Firebase Cloud Messaging) 
is the next build step.

I'm flagging this directly because I'd rather you trust everything else 
in this submission than have you wonder where the line is. PranAI started 
six months ago, outside this hackathon, because of a real conversation 
I had with my own parents — not because of a hackathon prompt. The parts 
that are real are real because I built them before this event existed. 
The parts that are simplified, I'm telling you so myself.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **87%** of Indian students experience exam-related anxiety
- **1 in 4** teenagers feel persistently sad or hopeless
- **70%** never seek help due to stigma or fear
- **₹1500-3000** is the cost of traditional therapy per session

**The Gap:** Parents want to help but are left in the dark. Students want support but fear judgment.
